# üå≤ Developer Productivity with AI üå≤

Welcome to the workshop! I am so glad you're here.

AI is changing how we write code, and you're about to become fluent in these new tools. We'll explore everything from basic AI integration to building sophisticated AI agents that can help with development tasks. Along the way, we‚Äôll take a closer look at the Vercel AI SDK and how this can help developers build streaming interfaces with TypeScript and Next.js.

## Workshop Installation Instructions

Make sure you have the following before the workshop begins:

1. This repo cloned or downloaded.
    * Each section has a start and complete folder.
2. A code editor of some sort.
3. [Node.js version 20+](https://nodejs.org/en)
4. Optional: An [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/). (I will provide test keys to use, so no worries if you don't want to take this step.)
