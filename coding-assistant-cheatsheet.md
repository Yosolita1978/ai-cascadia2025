ðŸ”¥ Hot Tips for Coding Assistants (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, etc)

## Code Generation

  - Be specific about frameworks: "Create a Next.js API route" vs "Create an
   API"
  - Mention existing patterns: "Following the same pattern as the other
  components"
  - Request multiple files: "Create both the component and its test file"
  - Ask for TypeScript: Always specify if you want typed code

## Project Analysis

- Start broad, then narrow: First understand the project structure, then
dive into specifics
- Ask for explanations: "Explain how this authentication system works"

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

- Share error messages: Copy the exact error, not just a description
- Include relevant files: Show both the failing code and related imports
- Ask for step-by-step fixes: "Walk me through debugging this issue"
- Request multiple solutions: "Give me 3 different ways to solve this"

## Best Practices

- Ask for code reviews: "Review this code for bugs and improvements"
- Request refactoring: "Make this more maintainable"
- Get security advice: "Check this for security vulnerabilities"
- Performance optimization: "How can I make this faster?"

## Learning & Documentation

- Ask "why" questions: "Why is this pattern better than alternatives?"
- Request examples: "Show me 3 different ways to handle this"
- Get explanations: "Explain this code like I'm new to React"
- Ask for resources: "What should I learn next to improve this?"

## Working with AI SDK

- Specify versions: "Using AI SDK v5" to get current patterns
- Ask for complete examples: Including imports, error handling, types
- Request provider comparisons: "OpenAI vs Anthropic for this use case"
- Get cost optimization tips: "How to reduce token usage here"

## Workflow Efficiency

- Batch related tasks: "Create the API route, frontend component, and
types"
- Use templates: "Create a new page following the same structure as
/about"
- Ask for checklists: "What do I need to deploy this feature?"
- Request testing strategies: "How should I test this component?"

## Advanced Techniques

- Architecture planning: "Help me design the data flow for this feature"
- Code organization: "How should I structure this large component?"
- Performance monitoring: "What metrics should I track for this AI
feature?"
- Scalability considerations: "How will this handle 1000x more users?"

## Common Patterns

- "Show me the modern way": Get current best practices
- "Make this production-ready": Add error handling, logging, validation
- "Convert this to TypeScript": Upgrade existing JavaScript
- "Add accessibility features": Make components inclusive

## Time-Saving Shortcuts

- Ask for git commands: "What git commands do I need for this workflow?"
- Request package suggestions: "What npm packages would help with this?"
- Get quick fixes: "Just show me the 2-line fix for this bug"

Remember: coding assistants are most helpful when you're specific about your
context, goals, and constraints. The more details you provide about your
project and what you're trying to achieve, the better the assistance
you'll get! ðŸš€
